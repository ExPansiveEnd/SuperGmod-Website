<div id="body" class="body"><p style="text-indent: 15px;">       Welcome to the "Super-Server" website. It is a project that I have dedicated to <i>THE</i> Super Garrys Mod Super-Server
    <p> CE. ExPansiveEnd <i>(PS: Player-Wiki coming soon)</i> </p>

    <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    
    The Super Garrys Mod server, better known as just <i>"Super"</i> by those who frequent it, including myself.
    Super was made and paid for (Still is) by its founder <i><b style="color: blue;">Console</b></i>, the server is also upheld by its current team of moderators
    <i style="color: #00FFE1;">The Spycrab</i>, <i style="color: #00FFE1;">Kel_Sey</i>, and Bikes, I think ?. (Also prolly some other people).

    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        Its official title is "Super Garrys Mod Server" and it has a LOT to offer. A thriving community of gamers, of different types. 
        For starters there are <a style="color: cyan;">"The Balds"</a> They are new players, who have absolutely ZERO sense of what is going on, and are clinically
        shown to have an IQ below 50. They will eventually evolve into the next version of their species. <a style="color: red;">"The average joe"</a>, this guy knows 
        whats up, he has basic knowlege of the server & is almost never targeted. These players are the second most commonly found here.
        Up the ladder even further, are <a style="color: purple;">"The Frequents"</a>. These players have anywhere from 15k to 30k Sandbucks, and are the chillest generally.
        Then there are the <a style="color: gold;"><i><b>"Elites"</b></i></a>, these guys have been playing Super for years, and their sandbux will show it
        from 30k to 200k sandbux, these are either the nicest and chillest, or baddest of the bad, you will ever find here.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        Thats just the "Average" interpretaion of the server heirarchy. This does not really sway the gameplay in any way, but it is an important social
        construct. (Know your place balds) 
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        The server is populated by up to 32 people at a time, and has a "Diverse" playerbase, mostly 14 year-olds. It is a <a style="color: red;">"Semi-Anarchy"</a> server
        where you can do whatever you want, aside from a few <i><b style="color: orange;">CRUCIAL</b></i> things. Generally no, crashing, hacking, cheating, or bitching.
        Dont be a nazi, and be respectful. (Those last two are rarely followed) 
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        The server is charactarized by its <a style="color: #DF00FF;"><i>"Charming"</i></a> & <a style="color: #DF00FF;"><i>"Quirky"</i></a> physics, and also
        all of the "entertaining" arguements... Ever heard the saying "Money makes the world go round'" ? Well its the same for Super, except for the fact that our 
        currency does "So much" for all of us, and our currency is called <i style="color: yellow;">"Sandbucks"</i> or <i style="color: yellow;">"Sandbux"</i>
        Its only real purpose is to unlock character skins. <b style="color: orangered;">BUT</b> there was a fabled <i style="color: yellow;">"Sandbux Shop"</i> 
        Going around January of 2025. But it's probably a hoax.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        As of recent <i><b style="color: blue;">Console</b></i> has not been as active, and the server is "Falling off" This is not true. The server frequently has
        20+ players. (#SaveSuper)
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        Previous mentions aside, Super has plenty of other cool features. Such as <i><b style="color: blue;">Super-Crates</b></i>. These boxes can be spawned through
        chat by typing "!crate", Spawning crates has about a 13 minute cooldown before you can spawn another. Also :), you can "Steal" other peoples' Super Crates. 
        You can get an array of "Useful" items from them. Including... 
    </p>
    <p style="color: brown;">♦ Trash, ♦ Plastic Container, ♦ Toothpick, ♦ Can</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">♦ Windows 95, ♦ Oil Drum, ♦ Responsibility</p>
    <p style="color: purple;">♦ Burger, ♦ Bikes Ball</p>
    <p style="color: green;">♦ RayGun, ♦ Suit Armor, ♦ Our-Pee-Gee</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        I will be copy an pasting this into the Wiki btw.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        Anyways all of that aside. Please enjoy my website and our Server.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">
        Thanks! ExPansiveEnd.
